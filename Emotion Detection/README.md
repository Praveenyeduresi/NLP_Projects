## Project Title : Emotion Detection from Text.

**Technologies Used**: 

**Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Scikit-learn, tensorflow

**Languages**: Python.

**Overview**:The main aim of this project is to build the effective model to predict the human emotions such as Happy, Sad, Anger etc., based on the content.

**The project follows several steps:**

**Data Preprocessing:** Text cleaning, Text normalization, Removed stop words, Tokenization, Lemmatization and feature engineering to prepare the data.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**:

**Observations** - The distribution of sentiment labels in the dataset shows Neutral & Worry classes having the highest counts i.e, more than 8000 tweets. However, Anger and boredom are having lowest count i.e, less than 1000 tweets. The histogram shows a right-skewed distribution of text lengths, peaking around 30-40 characters. Most texts are short, while longer texts are less frequent.

**Text Vectorization**:TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

**Machine Learning Models:** Trained and evaluated multiple models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, KNN, XGBoost.

**Deep Learning Approach:** Integrated a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to capture sequential patterns and context in textual data.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrix.

**Conclusion**: 
This project focused on detecting human emotions using natural language processing techniques. First, the text data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using extreme preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization. Next, Exploratory data analysis observed distributions. During modelling stage, performed evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
